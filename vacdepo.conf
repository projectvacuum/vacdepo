#
#  Apache httpd.conf include file for VacDepo
#
#  This file should placed at /etc/httpd/vacproject.conf.d/vacdepo.conf
#  where it will be loaded by the common Vac Project httpd.conf
#
#  Place vacdepo.cert.pem and vacdepo.key.pem in /etc/grid-security
#  and install the CA files in /etc/grid-security/certificates
#
#  If necessary, you can do this with:
#
#  cat >/etc/yum.repos.d/eugridpma.repo <<EOF
#  [eugridpma]
#  name=EUGridPMA
#  baseurl=http://dist.eugridpma.info/distribution/igtf/current/
#  gpgcheck=1
#  gpgkey=https://dist.eugridpma.info/distribution/igtf/current/GPG-KEY-EUGridPMA-RPM-3
#  EOF
#  yum -y install ca_policy_eugridpma
#
#  Things to check if you get no successful requests:
#  - iptables is disabled or allows incoming TCP on ports 80 and 443
#  - SE linux is diabled (echo 0 >/selinux/enforce) or configured to allow
#    httpd to access the paths in this file
